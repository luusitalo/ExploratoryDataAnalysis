# ExploratoryDataAnalysis
June 2015
These files are related to my course work in the Coursera course Exploratory Data Analysis, included in the Data Science Specialization.

The CourseProject1.R file includes all the plotting code in the same file; the plot1.R etc inlude only the code needed to produce the specified figure (plot1.png, etc).

The code assumes that the data has been unzipped to the working directory.
